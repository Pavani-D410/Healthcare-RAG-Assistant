# Healthcare-RAG-Assistant

Healthcare-RAG-Assistant is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based healthcare intelligence system designed to help users retrieve healthcare-related information from medical documents using conversational AI.

The system combines semantic retrieval, conversational memory, metadata filtering, grounded response generation, and streaming responses to provide accurate and document-aware healthcare answers with source citations.

# System Workflow

The application follows a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for healthcare document understanding and conversational question answering.

## Workflow Steps

1. User uploads healthcare PDF documents through the Streamlit interface.
2. PDF Loader extracts healthcare document content.
3. Metadata enrichment attaches:
   - document name
   - page number
4. RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter performs intelligent chunking.
5. HuggingFace sentence-transformers generate embeddings.
6. Embeddings are stored in FAISS Vector Database.
7. User submits healthcare-related queries.
8. Query embeddings are generated using the same embedding model.
9. Semantic retrieval searches relevant chunks using cosine similarity.
10. Metadata filtering optionally retrieves information from specific documents.
11. Conversational memory maintains previous chat context.
12. Prompt construction combines:
    - retrieved chunks
    - conversational context
    - healthcare metadata
    - user query
13. Grounded prompting reduces hallucinations.
14. Groq LLM generates healthcare-aware grounded responses.
15. Streaming responses display answers gradually in real time.
16. Source citations with document name and page number are attached to the final response.
